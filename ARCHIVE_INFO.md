# Archive Information

## Archive Created ✅

The old project folders have been moved to the `archive/` directory for safekeeping.

## What Was Archived

1. **`archive/quantum_2/`** - Original quantum-inspired islands system
   - Migrated to: `quantum/islands/`
   - Contains: 24 Python files + documentation

2. **`archive/quantum_computer/`** - Original hierarchical geometry system
   - Migrated to: `quantum/hierarchical/`
   - Contains: 41 Python files + documentation

3. **`archive/livnium_core_demo/`** - Original physics solver
   - Migrated to: `quantum/livnium_core/`
   - Contains: 4 Python files + documentation

4. **`archive/quantum_computer_code.zip`** (if present)
   - Archived zip file

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

- **Safety**: Keep backup until new structure is fully verified
- **Reference**: Can check old code if needed during transition
- **Rollback**: Can restore if needed (though migration is complete)

## When to Delete Archive

You can safely delete the `archive/` folder once you:
1. ✅ Have verified all your applications work with the new structure
2. ✅ Have updated any external code that references old paths
3. ✅ Are confident the migration is complete

## Current Status

- ✅ All code migrated to `quantum/` structure
- ✅ All imports fixed and verified
- ✅ Old folders safely archived
- ✅ New structure operational

## Next Steps

1. Test your applications with the new `quantum/` structure
2. Update any external references to use new import paths
3. Once verified, you can delete `archive/` folder
