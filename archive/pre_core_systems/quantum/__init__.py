Quantum-Inspired Classical Systems

This module contains three fundamentally different quantum-inspired classical engines:
- islands: Quantum-Inspired Islands Engine (105–500+ qubit-analogous units)
- hierarchical: Hierarchical Geometry Machine (5000+ qubit-analogue capacity)
- livnium_core: Real 1D Physics Solver (DMRG/MPS tensor-network algorithm)

Important: These are quantum-inspired classical systems, NOT physical quantum computers.
