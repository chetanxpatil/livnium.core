# Quantum-Inspired Islands Engine

**This is a quantum-inspired classical system. It is NOT a physical quantum computer.**

## Overview

The Quantum-Inspired Islands Engine is an information-theoretic system that uses quantum-inspired concepts (qubit analogues, entanglement-like correlations) for classical computation. It can handle 105–500+ qubit-analogous units efficiently.

## Key Features

- Independent qubit analogues (linear scaling)
- Pairwise entanglement-like correlations
- Geometric cube structure (3×3×3)
- Feature integration and classification

## Architecture

- `core/` - Core components (kernel, geometric simulator, quantum islands)
- `gates/` - Gate operations
- `features/` - Feature integration
- `classifiers/` - Classification integration
- `utils/` - Utilities (bloch_to_cube, interference_resolution)
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation

## Usage

```python
from quantum.islands.core.kernel import LivniumQubit, EntangledPair
from quantum.islands.core.geometric_simulator import GeometricQuantumSimulator
```

## Important Note

This system uses quantum-inspired language and concepts, but operates entirely on classical hardware. It does not perform actual quantum computation.
