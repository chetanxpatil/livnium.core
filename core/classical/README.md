# Classical Layer

The classical geometry engine that forms the foundation of Livnium.

## Contents

- **`livnium_core_system.py`**: Main system class that manages the 3D lattice, cells, and geometric operations.

## Purpose

This module provides the core geometric infrastructure:
- 3D lattice structure (omcubes)
- Cell management (face exposure, symbolic weights, polarity)
- Tension field computation
- Geometric operations and transformations

This is the "Layer 0" that all other systems build upon.
