Persistent memory cells that store and recall information across episodes.

## Contents

- **`memory_cell.py`**: Individual memory cell implementation
- **`memory_lattice.py`**: Lattice of memory cells
- **`memory_coupling.py`**: Coupling between memory cells

## Purpose

This module provides:
- **Persistent storage**: Information survives across episodes
- **Associative recall**: Memory cells can be queried by content
- **Coupling**: Memories can be linked together
- **Decay**: Old memories fade over time

Used by NLI system and other learning applications.
