# Reasoning Engine

Native logic and rule-based reasoning capabilities.

## Contents

- **`reasoning_engine.py`**: Main reasoning orchestrator
- **`rule_engine.py`**: Rule-based inference
- **`problem_solver.py`**: Problem decomposition and solving
- **`search_engine.py`**: Search strategies for reasoning

## Purpose

This module provides:
- **Rule-based inference**: Apply logical rules to facts
- **Problem decomposition**: Break complex problems into subproblems
- **Search strategies**: Explore solution spaces
- **Native logic**: Built-in reasoning without neural networks

Used for constraint satisfaction, logical inference, and problem solving.
