# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

Go to your repository on GitHub → **Settings** → **General** → Scroll to **About** section

### 1. Repository Description
Copy and paste this:

```
Quantum-Inspired Geometric Computing & Native Language Understanding - Pure native AI with zero transformers, embeddings, or neural networks. Letter-by-letter chained omcubes architecture.
```

### 2. Topics/Tags
Add these topics (one per line or comma-separated):

```
quantum-computing
geometric-computing
natural-language-inference
tensor-networks
matrix-product-states
native-ai
quantum-inspired
language-understanding
geometric-reasoning
livnium
omcube
mps-architecture
research-software
computational-physics
letter-by-letter-encoding
phoneme-layer
```

### 3. Website (Optional)
Leave blank or add if you have a documentation site.

### 4. License Note
GitHub shows "Unknown license" because Livnium License v1.1 is proprietary. This is expected and correct. The LICENSE file is there and will be visible to users.
